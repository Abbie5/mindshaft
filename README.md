# mindshaft

a density-focused minimap, loosely inspired by Rei's Minimap of the days of yore.

has: fullscreen toggle, configurable zoom levels, an ugly player cursor, a fairly esoteric indicator of whether voids are above or below player, and a small amount of stutter to rendering that will probably drive some people spare

todo: threaded processing (lol someday), more configurable performance facets (meantime, you can just drop problematic zoom levels), rendering settings (not everyone will want the fancy colored bits?), cheat mode? (disable light checks)

meantime: it works. ship it.
